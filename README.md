# Daily Work Scheduler

## Description

This is a daily work schedule page that can be used to keep track of what you have going on for the day. The hours are from 9am until 5pm. In the respective boxes you are able to type what you need to get done through the day with the corresponding hours. You are also able to click the save button to save the daily task items you have typed. This saves your input to the local storage of your machine so even if the page is closed or refreshed you are still able to open it up to see what you have going on throughout the day.
